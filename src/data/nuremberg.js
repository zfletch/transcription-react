                    such a title is said before in Hebrew for the victory in the instruments of the

                    <lb n="29"/>

                    song of the Psalm. Also in Jerome's translation it is called the canticle of canticles

                    <lb n="30"/>

                    for the Lord in psalm. And the same thought is in each which is partly from the above mentioned Psalm 4.

                    <lb n="31"/>

                    From the title the author for these is not clearly the author of the psalm nor the music. Some authors

                    <lb n="32"/>

                    say about this that that psalm

                    <lb n="33"/>

                    is an act of thanksgiving

                    <lb n="34"/>

                    for the fertility of a certain

                    <lb n="35"/>

                    year. For the Jews, after they had

                    <lb n="36"/>

                    harvested fruits,

                    <lb n="37"/>

                    convened in September

                    <lb n="38"/>

                    in Jerusalem, which month was

                    <lb n="39"/>

                    almost entirely festive. Since

                    <lb n="40"/>

                    in that month there

                    <lb n="41"/>

                    was a festival of trumpets and a festival

                    <lb n="42"/>

                    of atonement and of tabernacles

                    <lb n="42"/>

                    and a festival of Seder

                    <lb n="43"/>

                    harvest. As it is said

                    <lb n="44"/>

                    in Leviticus 23. And

                    <lb n="45"/>

                    whenever a year was

                    <lb n="46"/>

                    fertile: it was customary that

                    <lb n="47"/>

                    one very high, holy and faithful man

                    <lb n="48"/>

                    made a special song

                    <lb n="49"/>

                    for the act of thanksgiving.

                    <lb n="50"/>

                    And thus it was about this psalm they talk: but they do not explain who

                    <lb n="51"/>

                    the author was. After this then that psalm is divided into two parts.

                    <lb n="52"/>

                    Since first the imploring for fertility is placed. In the second part, because of its pretense

                    <lb n="53"/>

                    the act of thanksgiving is placed there. They are confident about the first, it is said.

                    <lb n="54"/>

                    a. "May God have mercy on us" to release our sins b. "and

                    <lb n="55"/>

                    may He bless us." We would be blessed by increasing in the goodness of our spirits and bodies.

                    <lb n="56"/>

                    c. "May He shine His countenance over us." The scripture says

                    <lb n="57"/>

                    about God who in the manner of man, when He wishes to do a grace for someone, shows

                    <lb n="58"/>

                    to him His cheerful and happy face. d. "So that we may know" "on earth."

                    <lb n="59"/>

                    That is, in the fertility of the land e. "Your way." That is, the traces of Your

                    <lb n="60"/>

                    grace through the result of fertility which has been granted. f. "Your salvation in all peoples."

                    <lb n="61"/>

                    That is, so that it is common knowledge to all peoples that You have a special cure for our salvation,

                    <lb n="62"/>

                    therefore it applies. g. "May the people have faith in You, oh God." That is, through the result granted

                    <lb n="63"/>

                    to us may they believe in Your goodness and divinity: and may they be turned to You

                    <lb n="64"/>

                    as it is said that when the Jews were wonderfully freed from the

                    <lb n="65"/>

                    persecution of Haman, many kinsmen throughout diverse parts were joined in celebrations

                    <lb n="66"/>

                    of these, as it is said in Esther 8. h. "Let the people be glad and rejoice" etc. Just as

                    <lb n="67"/>

                    He made this easy with Haman, who by divine judgement was hanged with his sons.

                    <lb n="68"/>

                    i. And "the people on earth You direct." Since, through such results, You direct

                    <lb n="69"/>

                    people to awareness of Your truth. k. "May the people believe in You,

                    <lb n="70"/>

                    oh God" In response to this is placed the act of thanksgiving for the fertility they obtained,

                    <lb n="71"/>

                    as it is said. k. "May the people believe in You, oh God" with a holy profession of Your praise

                    <lb n="72"/>

                    and for this reason they ought thus to believe. Therefore it applies. l. "The land gave its fruit"

                    <lb n="73"/>

                    in great abundance through the goodness of Your grace. Therefore it applies.

                    <lb n="74"/>

                    m. "May God, our god, bless us" concerning the future as He has now done

                    <lb n="75"/>

                    concerning the past. n. And "All the ends of the earth fear Him" as the judgment of all for the

                    <lb n="76"/>

                    purpose of punishing evil deeds is very powerful. Although the author agrees to say this statement in many

                    <lb n="77"/>

                    points; nevertheless, see that some things are not irrelevant, that because of the fertility in

                    <lb n="78"/>

                    Judea which is a poor land, all kinsmen and people of the world would be invited

                    <lb n="79"/>

                    to a confession of divine praise: and especially since such fertility

                    <lb n="80"/>

                    was not in other lands. Wherefore with safe, better judgment it seems

                    <lb n="81"/>

                    to me that that psalm was not an act of thanksgiving for past goodness, but

                    <lb n="82"/>

                    rather it is a prophecy about the future about the sacred incarnation of Christ and His

                    <lb n="83"/>

                    close association among men. It seems to me that a certain goodness was highly desired by the holy fathers

                    <lb n="84"/>

                    because, see that some sacred prophet, whoever he was,

                    <lb n="85"/>

                    made that psalm concerning this. It is said "May God have mercy on us" by sending

                    <lb n="86"/>

                    salvation to us and by bestowing on us His own good grace. "He shines

                    <lb n="87"/>

                    His countenance over us" by glorifying His own son by means of miracles. He who is said to be the countenance

                    <lb n="88"/>

                    of His father. Since He is His image. That is, as it is said according to Luke. God sent into the kingdom

                    <lb n="89"/>

                    an image of His love for His son, who is the image of the invisible God. He was seeking this name: savior.

                    <lb n="90"/>

                    John 17: "Father, glorify Your son." And He Himself answered, "I have glorified Him and

                    <lb n="91"/>

                    I shall glorify Him again." Since He glorified Him with miracles before His death and after

                    <lb n="92"/>

                    His resurrection. And "may He have mercy on us" by freeing us from Gehenna through

                    <lb n="93"/>

                    the blood of His son. "So that we might know his way on earth." The psalm converts the word

                    <lb n="94"/>

                    to Christ, whose life was known to men by his conversations among men,

                    <lb n="95"/>

                    by his teachings and his healing. "Your salvation in all nations."

                    <lb n="96"/>

                    since the salvation made through Christ is known to all nations through the

                    <cb n="iv"/>

                    <lb n="97"/>

                    preaching of the apostles according to what is said in Psalm 18. "The second went into

                    <lb n="98"/>

                    every land of ours" etc. May the people have faith in You, God. By having faith in

                    <lb n="99"/>

                    Your divinity, may all the people have faith in You, by pressing upon the servitude of faith.

                    <lb n="100"/>

                    Let them rejoice and exult, the nations, in Your voice and for their faith in Christ since You judge

                    <lb n="101"/>

                    the people in equality. By calling to faith, placing themselves in Your just works without

                    <lb n="102"/>

                    accepting false persons,

                    <lb n="103"/>

                    from there, Peter, seeing

                    <lb n="104"/>

                    the call of Cornelius, a just man,

                    <lb n="105"/>

                    said Acts 10. In

                    <lb n="106"/>

                    truth, I have learned that there

                    <lb n="107"/>

                    is no accepting of false persons

                    <lb n="108"/>

                    in the presence of God; but in every nation,

                    <lb n="109"/>

                    he who fears God and labors

                    <lb n="110"/>

                    towards accepting justice,

                    <lb n="111"/>

                    is His. It is supplied for that reason. And

                    <lb n="112"/>

                    the nations on Earth, You lead them

                    <lb n="113"/>

                    into the path of eternal health.

                    <lb n="114"/>

                    May all the people have faith in You, God,

                    <lb n="115"/>

                    and in whatever way they should have faith.

                    <lb n="116"/>

                    It is supplied as it is spoken. "The land

                    <lb n="117"/>

                    gave its fruit." That is,

                    <lb n="118"/>

                    the blessed virgin has produced a son.

                    <lb n="119"/>

                    Of what earth, it is said in Isaiah

                    <lb n="120"/>

                    45: "May the earth open; and

                    <lb n="121"/>

                    produce the savior." And, it is because they were calling for faith and baptizing,

                    <lb n="122"/>

                    in the name of the Trinity, according to what is written the last book of Matthew: "Go and teach

                    <lb n="123"/>

                    all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." It is supplied for that reason.

                    <lb n="124"/>

                    May God bless us by bringing to us the grace of baptism. And it is said, "may He

                    <lb n="125"/>

                    bless us each" for showing the unity of His essence. And thrice God,

                    <lb n="126"/>

                    for showing the trinity of His persons, just as is said in Isaiah 6, the trinity

                    <lb n="127"/>

                    of persons is shown through the Seraphin. Thrice He is holy in his clemency and the unity of His essence

                    <lb n="128"/>

                    through which it is supplied. God of hosts, even let all the ends of the earth fear Him.

                    <lb n="129"/>

                    It is not by servile fear, but filial fear, that he stands with charity. Psalm 67.

                    <lb n="130"/>

                    May God rise up. Such a title is allowed for this psalm in Hebrew. For

                    <lb n="131"/>

                    The Victory of David psalm. Also in Jerome's translation it is called To the

                    <lb n="132"/>

                    Victor David psalm. In either case, the meaning of the song is the same, what remains

                    <lb n="133"/>

                    from the aforementioned other titles. From the title: with respect to the author, the author of this psalm appears to be holy David.

                    <lb n="134"/>

                    About the material of this psalm: Rashi and the other Jews and other Catholic doctors

                    <lb n="135"/>

                    following them in this say that David wrote this psalm for offering thanks for the action

                    <lb n="136"/>

                    of the favor shown to the people of Israel

                    <lb n="137"/>

                    in part for the exodus from Egypt and in part for the journey through the desert, and also in part for the entry into the promised land

                    <lb n="138"/>

                    and the exit afterwards. They say, however, these favors are not placed

                    <lb n="139"/>

                    in this psalm  in the same order they were done. But, how much earlier, it

                    <lb n="140"/>

                    is placed that much later, and the converse. Since this interpretation is very much

                    <lb n="141"/>

                    intertwined, and it appears to be twisted in some parts, and along with this, significantly prolix, for this reason,

                    <lb n="142"/>

                    I send it away and accept another which agrees with the New Testament.

                    <lb n="143"/>

                    For Paul the apostle in Ephesians 4, quoted the scripture of this

                    <lb n="144"/>

                    psalm about the sending of the Holy Spirit after the ascent of Christ. To each one

                    <lb n="145"/>

                    of us, thanks is given according the the measure of the gift of Jesus Christ because of

                    <lb n="146"/>

                    what he said: "Ascending to heaven, He led captive captivity. He gave

                    <lb n="147"/>

                    gifts to men." This is what the psalm appears to be. He, in this letter, said it should

                    <lb n="148"/>

                    not be an act of thanks for previous favors, but rather a prophecy for

                    <lb n="149"/>

                    future events through Christ; what David sees in spirit, he made into this psalm.

                    <lb n="150"/>

                    Therefore, according to this sense, this psalm is divided into two parts. Because

                    <lb n="151"/>
