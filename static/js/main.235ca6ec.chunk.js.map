And the same thought is in each which is partly from the above mentioned Psalm 4.\n\n                    <lb n=\"31\"/>\n\n                    From the title the author for these is not clearly the author of the psalm nor the music. Some authors\n\n                    <lb n=\"32\"/>\n\n                    say about this that that psalm\n\n                    <lb n=\"33\"/>\n\n                    is an act of thanksgiving\n\n                    <lb n=\"34\"/>\n\n                    for the fertility of a certain\n\n                    <lb n=\"35\"/>\n\n                    year. For the Jews, after they had\n\n                    <lb n=\"36\"/>\n\n                    harvested fruits,\n\n                    <lb n=\"37\"/>\n\n                    convened in September\n\n                    <lb n=\"38\"/>\n\n                    in Jerusalem, which month was\n\n                    <lb n=\"39\"/>\n\n                    almost entirely festive. Since\n\n                    <lb n=\"40\"/>\n\n                    in that month there\n\n                    <lb n=\"41\"/>\n\n                    was a festival of trumpets and a festival\n\n                    <lb n=\"42\"/>\n\n                    of atonement and of tabernacles\n\n                    <lb n=\"42\"/>\n\n                    and a festival of Seder\n\n                    <lb n=\"43\"/>\n\n                    harvest. As it is said\n\n                    <lb n=\"44\"/>\n\n                    in Leviticus 23. And\n\n                    <lb n=\"45\"/>\n\n                    whenever a year was\n\n                    <lb n=\"46\"/>\n\n                    fertile: it was customary that\n\n                    <lb n=\"47\"/>\n\n                    one very high, holy and faithful man\n\n                    <lb n=\"48\"/>\n\n                    made a special song\n\n                    <lb n=\"49\"/>\n\n                    for the act of thanksgiving.\n\n                    <lb n=\"50\"/>\n\n                    And thus it was about this psalm they talk: but they do not explain who\n\n                    <lb n=\"51\"/>\n\n                    the author was. After this then that psalm is divided into two parts.\n\n                    <lb n=\"52\"/>\n\n                    Since first the imploring for fertility is placed. In the second part, because of its pretense\n\n                    <lb n=\"53\"/>\n\n                    the act of thanksgiving is placed there. They are confident about the first, it is said.\n\n                    <lb n=\"54\"/>\n\n                    a. \"May God have mercy on us\" to release our sins b. \"and\n\n                    <lb n=\"55\"/>\n\n                    may He bless us.\" We would be blessed by increasing in the goodness of our spirits and bodies.\n\n                    <lb n=\"56\"/>\n\n                    c. \"May He shine His countenance over us.\" The scripture says\n\n                    <lb n=\"57\"/>\n\n                    about God who in the manner of man, when He wishes to do a grace for someone, shows\n\n                    <lb n=\"58\"/>\n\n                    to him His cheerful and happy face. d. \"So that we may know\" \"on earth.\"\n\n                    <lb n=\"59\"/>\n\n                    That is, in the fertility of the land e. \"Your way.\" That is, the traces of Your\n\n                    <lb n=\"60\"/>\n\n                    grace through the result of fertility which has been granted. f. \"Your salvation in all peoples.\"\n\n                    <lb n=\"61\"/>\n\n                    That is, so that it is common knowledge to all peoples that You have a special cure for our salvation,\n\n                    <lb n=\"62\"/>\n\n                    therefore it applies. g. \"May the people have faith in You, oh God.\" That is, through the result granted\n\n                    <lb n=\"63\"/>\n\n                    to us may they believe in Your goodness and divinity: and may they be turned to You\n\n                    <lb n=\"64\"/>\n\n                    as it is said that when the Jews were wonderfully freed from the\n\n                    <lb n=\"65\"/>\n\n                    persecution of Haman, many kinsmen throughout diverse parts were joined in celebrations\n\n                    <lb n=\"66\"/>\n\n                    of these, as it is said in Esther 8. h. \"Let the people be glad and rejoice\" etc. Just as\n\n                    <lb n=\"67\"/>\n\n                    He made this easy with Haman, who by divine judgement was hanged with his sons.\n\n                    <lb n=\"68\"/>\n\n                    i. And \"the people on earth You direct.\" Since, through such results, You direct\n\n                    <lb n=\"69\"/>\n\n                    people to awareness of Your truth. k. \"May the people believe in You,\n\n                    <lb n=\"70\"/>\n\n                    oh God\" In response to this is placed the act of thanksgiving for the fertility they obtained,\n\n                    <lb n=\"71\"/>\n\n                    as it is said. k. \"May the people believe in You, oh God\" with a holy profession of Your praise\n\n                    <lb n=\"72\"/>\n\n                    and for this reason they ought thus to believe. Therefore it applies. l. \"The land gave its fruit\"\n\n                    <lb n=\"73\"/>\n\n                    in great abundance through the goodness of Your grace. Therefore it applies.\n\n                    <lb n=\"74\"/>\n\n                    m. \"May God, our god, bless us\" concerning the future as He has now done\n\n                    <lb n=\"75\"/>\n\n                    concerning the past. n. And \"All the ends of the earth fear Him\" as the judgment of all for the\n\n                    <lb n=\"76\"/>\n\n                    purpose of punishing evil deeds is very powerful. Although the author agrees to say this statement in many\n\n                    <lb n=\"77\"/>\n\n                    points; nevertheless, see that some things are not irrelevant, that because of the fertility in\n\n                    <lb n=\"78\"/>\n\n                    Judea which is a poor land, all kinsmen and people of the world would be invited\n\n                    <lb n=\"79\"/>\n\n                    to a confession of divine praise: and especially since such fertility\n\n                    <lb n=\"80\"/>\n\n                    was not in other lands.

It seems to me that a certain goodness was highly desired by the holy fathers\n\n                    <lb n=\"84\"/>\n\n                    because, see that some sacred prophet, whoever he was,\n\n                    <lb n=\"85\"/>\n\n                    made that psalm concerning this. It is said \"May God have mercy on us\" by sending\n\n                    <lb n=\"86\"/>\n\n                    salvation to us and by bestowing on us His own good grace. \"He shines\n\n                    <lb n=\"87\"/>\n\n                    His countenance over us\" by glorifying His own son by means of miracles.

Also in Jerome's translation it is called To the\n\n                    <lb n=\"132\"/>\n\n                    Victor David psalm.

From the title: with respect to the author, the author of this psalm appears to be holy David.\n\n                    <lb n=\"134\"/>\n\n                    About the material of this psalm: Rashi and the other Jews and other Catholic doctors\n\n                    <lb n=\"135\"/>\n\n                    following them in this say that David wrote this psalm for offering thanks for the action\n\n                    <lb n=\"136\"/>\n\n                    of the favor shown to the people of Israel\n\n                    <lb n=\"137\"/>\n\n                    in part for the exodus from Egypt and in part for the journey through the desert, and also in part for the entry into the promised land\n\n                    <lb n=\"138\"/>\n\n                    and the exit afterwards. They say, however, these favors are not placed\n\n                    <lb n=\"139\"/>\n\n                    in this psalm  in the same order they were done. But, how much earlier, it\n\n                    <lb n=\"140\"/>\n\n                    is placed that much later, and the converse. Since this interpretation is very much\n\n                    <lb n=\"141\"/>\n\n                    intertwined, and it appears to be twisted in some parts, and along with this, significantly prolix, for this reason,\n\n                    <lb n=\"142\"/>\n\n                    I send it away and accept another which agrees with the New Testament.\n\n                    <lb n=\"143\"/>\n\n                    For Paul the apostle in Ephesians 4, quoted the scripture of this\n\n                    <lb n=\"144\"/>\n\n                    psalm about the sending of the Holy Spirit after the ascent of Christ. To each one\n\n                    <lb n=\"145\"/>\n\n                    of us, thanks is given according the the measure of the gift of Jesus Christ because of\n\n                    <lb n=\"146\"/>\n\n                    what he said: \"Ascending to heaven, He led captive captivity. He gave\n\n                    <lb n=\"147\"/>\n\n                    gifts to men.\" This is what the psalm appears to be. He, in this letter, said it should\n\n                    <lb n=\"148\"/>\n\n                    not be an act of thanks for previous favors, but rather a prophecy for\n\n                    <lb n=\"149\"/>\n\n                    future events through Christ; what David sees in spirit, he made into this psalm.\n\n                    <lb n=\"150\"/>\n\n                    Therefore, according to this sense, this psalm is divided into two parts. Because\n\n                    <lb n=\"151\"/>\n\n                    at first it is about the resurrection of Christ. Secondly, it is about His ascension. And\n\n                    <lb n=\"152\"/>\n\n                    along with these things, it is about the following favors after these things. The second part starts here:\n\n                    <lb n=\"153\"/>\n\n                    \"Sing to God.\" Around the beginning, David proposes the resurrection of Christ.\n\n                    <lb n=\"154\"/>\n\n                    a. “May God arise.\" Because Christ was dead from\n\n                    <lb n=\"155\"/>\n\n                    the infirmity of His humanity. But he was resurrected from the virtue of his divinity.\n\n                    <lb n=\"156\"/>\n\n                    b. \"And His enemies be scattered.\" That is, the Jews who are in\n\n                    <lb n=\"157\"/>\n\n                    punishment for the death of Christ, since in the time of Titus and Vespasian, they were in part\n\n                    <lb n=\"158\"/>\n\n                    massacred and in part captured and otherwise dispersed through the world, or treated otherwise similarly.\n\n                    <lb n=\"159\"/>\n\n                    \"His enemies.\" That is, evil spirits who, when Christ was rising, were\n\n                    <lb n=\"160\"/>\n\n                    confounded and despoiled. c. \"And those who hate Him flee.\" That is,\n\n                    <lb n=\"161\"/>\n\n                    demons. d. \"From His face.\" Because after the resurrection, in the\n\n                    <lb n=\"162\"/>\n\n                    name of Christ, the demons fled from the possessed.\n\n                    <lb n=\"163\"/>\n\n                    e. \"Just as smoke dies out.\" It is not for this being discovered:\n\n                    <lb n=\"164\"/>\n\n                    how great the corruption of their nature is, since they are\n\n                    <lb n=\"165\"/>\n\n                    immortal.
