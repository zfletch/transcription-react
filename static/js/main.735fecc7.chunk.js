Since\n\n                    <lb n="40"/>\n\n                    in that month there\n\n                    <lb n="41"/>\n\n                    was a festival of trumpets and a festival\n\n                    <lb n="42"/>\n\n                    of atonement and of tabernacles\n\n                    <lb n="42"/>\n\n                    and a festival of Seder\n\n                    <lb n="43"/>\n\n                    harvest. As it is said\n\n                    <lb n="44"/>\n\n                    in Leviticus 23. And\n\n                    <lb n="45"/>\n\n                    whenever a year was\n\n                    <lb n="46"/>\n\n                    fertile: it was customary that\n\n                    <lb n="47"/>\n\n                    one very high, holy and faithful man\n\n                    <lb n="48"/>\n\n                    made a special song\n\n                    <lb n="49"/>\n\n                    for the act of thanksgiving.\n\n                    <lb n="50"/>\n\n                    And thus it was about this psalm they talk: but they do not explain who\n\n                    <lb n="51"/>\n\n                    the author was. After this then that psalm is divided into two parts.\n\n                    <lb n="52"/>\n\n                    Since first the imploring for fertility is placed. In the second part, because of its pretense\n\n                    <lb n="53"/>\n\n                    the act of thanksgiving is placed there. They are confident about the first, it is said.\n\n                    <lb n="54"/>\n\n                    a. "May God have mercy on us" to release our sins b. "and\n\n                    <lb n="55"/>\n\n                    may He bless us." We would be blessed by increasing in the goodness of our spirits and bodies.\n\n                    <lb n="56"/>\n\n                    c. "May He shine His countenance over us." The scripture says\n\n                    <lb n="57"/>\n\n                    about God who in the manner of man, when He wishes to do a grace for someone, shows\n\n                    <lb n="58"/>\n\n                    to him His cheerful and happy face. d. "So that we may know" "on earth."\n\n                    <lb n="59"/>\n\n                    That is, in the fertility of the land e. "Your way." That is, the traces of Your\n\n                    <lb n="60"/>\n\n                    grace through the result of fertility which has been granted. f. "Your salvation in all peoples."\n\n                    <lb n="61"/>\n\n                    That is, so that it is common knowledge to all peoples that You have a special cure for our salvation,\n\n                    <lb n="62"/>\n\n                    therefore it applies. g. "May the people have faith in You, oh God." That is, through the result granted\n\n                    <lb n="63"/>\n\n                    to us may they believe in Your goodness and divinity: and may they be turned to You\n\n                    <lb n="64"/>\n\n                    as it is said that when the Jews were wonderfully freed from the\n\n                    <lb n="65"/>\n\n                    persecution of Haman, many kinsmen throughout diverse parts were joined in celebrations\n\n                    <lb n="66"/>\n\n                    of these, as it is said in Esther 8. h. "Let the people be glad and rejoice" etc. Just as\n\n                    <lb n="67"/>\n\n                    He made this easy with Haman, who by divine judgement was hanged with his sons.\n\n                    <lb n="68"/>\n\n                    i. And "the people on earth You direct." Since, through such results, You direct\n\n                    <lb n="69"/>\n\n                    people to awareness of Your truth. k. "May the people believe in You,\n\n                    <lb n="70"/>\n\n                    oh God" In response to this is placed the act of thanksgiving for the fertility they obtained,\n\n                    <lb n="71"/>\n\n                    as it is said. k. "May the people believe in You, oh God" with a holy profession of Your praise\n\n                    <lb n="72"/>\n\n                    and for this reason they ought thus to believe. Therefore it applies. l. "The land gave its fruit"\n\n                    <lb n="73"/>\n\n                    in great abundance through the goodness of Your grace. Therefore it applies.\n\n                    <lb n="74"/>\n\n                    m. "May God, our god, bless us" concerning the future as He has now done\n\n                    <lb n="75"/>\n\n                    concerning the past. n. And "All the ends of the earth fear Him" as the judgment of all for the\n\n                    <lb n="76"/>\n\n                    purpose of punishing evil deeds is very powerful. Although the author agrees to say this statement in many\n\n                    <lb n="77"/>\n\n                    points; nevertheless, see that some things are not irrelevant, that because of the fertility in\n\n                    <lb n="78"/>\n\n                    Judea which is a poor land, all kinsmen and people of the world would be invited\n\n                    <lb n="79"/>\n\n                    to a confession of divine praise: and especially since such fertility\n\n                    <lb n="80"/>\n\n                    was not in other lands. Wherefore with safe, better judgment it seems\n\n                    <lb n="81"/>\n\n                    to me that that psalm was not an act of thanksgiving for past goodness, but\n\n                    <lb n="82"/>\n\n                    rather it is a prophecy about the future about the sacred incarnation of Christ and His\n\n                    <lb n="83"/>\n\n                    close association among men. It seems to me that a certain goodness was highly desired by the holy fathers\n\n                    <lb n="84"/>\n\n                    because, see that some sacred prophet, whoever he was,\n\n                    <lb n="85"/>\n\n                    made that psalm concerning this. It is said "May God have mercy on us" by sending\n\n                    <lb n="86"/>\n\n                    salvation to us and by bestowing on us His own good grace. "He shines\n\n                    <lb n="87"/>\n\n                    His countenance over us" by glorifying His own son by means of miracles. He who is said to be the countenance\n\n                    <lb n="88"/>\n\n                    of His father. Since He is His image. That is, as it is said according to Luke. God sent into the kingdom\n\n                    <lb n="89"/>\n\n                    an image of His love for His son, who is the image of the invisible God. He was seeking this name: savior.\n\n                    <lb n="90"/>\n\n                    John 17: "Father, glorify Your son." And He Himself answered, "I have glorified Him and\n\n                    <lb n="91"/>\n\n                    I shall glorify Him again." Since He glorified Him with miracles before His death and after\n\n                    <lb n="92"/>\n\n                    His resurrection. And "may He have mercy on us" by freeing us from Gehenna through\n\n                    <lb n="93"/>\n\n                    the blood of His son. "So that we might know his way on earth." The psalm converts the word\n\n                    <lb n="94"/>\n\n                    to Christ, whose life was known to men by his conversations among men,\n\n                    <lb n="95"/>\n\n                    by his teachings and his healing. "Your salvation in all nations."\n\n                    <lb n="96"/>\n\n                    since the salvation made through Christ is known to all nations through the\n\n                    <cb n="iv"/>\n\n                    <lb n="97"/>\n\n                    preaching of the apostles according to what is said in Psalm 18. "The second went into\n\n                    <lb n="98"/>\n\n                    every land of ours" etc. May the people have faith in You, God. By having faith in\n\n                    <lb n="99"/>\n\n                    Your divinity, may all the people have faith in You, by pressing upon the servitude of faith.\n\n                    <lb n="100"/>\n\n                    Let them rejoice and exult, the nations, in Your voice and for their faith in Christ since You judge\n\n                    <lb n="101"/>\n\n                    the people in equality. By calling to faith, placing themselves in Your just works without\n\n                    <lb n="102"/>\n\n                    accepting false persons,\n\n                    <lb n="103"/>\n\n                    from there, Peter, seeing\n\n                    <lb n="104"/>\n\n                    the call of Cornelius, a just man,\n\n                    <lb n="105"/>\n\n                    said Acts 10. In\n\n                    <lb n="106"/>\n\n                    truth, I have learned that there\n\n                    <lb n="107"/>\n\n                    is no accepting of false persons\n\n                    <lb n="108"/>\n\n                    in the presence of God; but in every nation,\n\n                    <lb n="109"/>\n\n                    he who fears God and labors\n\n                    <lb n="110"/>\n\n                    towards accepting justice,\n\n                    <lb n="111"/>\n\n                    is His. It is supplied for that reason. And\n\n                    <lb n="112"/>\n\n                    the nations on Earth, You lead them\n\n                    <lb n="113"/>\n\n                    into the path of eternal health.\n\n                    <lb n="114"/>\n\n                    May all the people have faith in You, God,\n\n                    <lb n="115"/>\n\n                    and in whatever way they should have faith.\n\n                    <lb n="116"/>\n\n                    It is supplied as it is spoken. "The land\n\n                    <lb n="117"/>\n\n                    gave its fruit." That is,\n\n                    <lb n="118"/>\n\n                    the blessed virgin has produced a son.\n\n                    <lb n="119"/>\n\n                    Of what earth, it is said in Isaiah\n\n                    <lb n="120"/>\n\n                    45: "May the earth open; and\n\n                    <lb n="121"/>\n\n                    produce the savior." And, it is because they were calling for faith and baptizing,\n\n                    <lb n="122"/>\n\n                    in the name of the Trinity, according to what is written the last book of Matthew: "Go and teach\n\n                    <lb n="123"/>\n\n                    all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." It is supplied for that reason.\n\n                    <lb n="124"/>\n\n                    May God bless us by bringing to us the grace of baptism. And it is said, "may He\n\n                    <lb n="125"/>\n\n                    bless us each" for showing the unity of His essence. And thrice God,\n\n                    <lb n="126"/>\n\n                    for showing the trinity of His persons, just as is said in Isaiah 6, the trinity\n\n                    <lb n="127"/>\n\n                    of persons is shown through the Seraphin. Thrice He is holy in his clemency and the unity of His essence\n\n                    <lb n="128"/>\n\n                    through which it is supplied. God of hosts, even let all the ends of the earth fear Him.\n\n                    <lb n="129"/>\n\n                    It is not by servile fear, but filial fear, that he stands with charity. Psalm 67.\n\n                    <lb n="130"/>\n\n                    May God rise up. Such a title is allowed for this psalm in Hebrew. For\n\n                    <lb n="131"/>\n\n                    The Victory of David psalm. Also in Jerome\'s translation it is called To the\n\n                    <lb n="132"/>\n\n                    Victor David psalm. In either case, the meaning of the song is the same, what remains\n\n                    <lb n="133"/>\n\n                    from the aforementioned other titles. From the title: with respect to the author, the author of this psalm appears to be holy David.\n\n                    <lb n="134"/>\n\n                    About the material of this psalm: Rashi and the other Jews and other Catholic doctors\n\n                    <lb n="135"/>\n\n                    following them in this say that David wrote this psalm for offering thanks for the action\n\n                    <lb n="136"/>\n\n                    of the favor shown to the people of Israel\n\n                    <lb n="137"/>\n\n                    in part for the exodus from Egypt and in part for the journey through the desert, and also in part for the entry into the promised land\n\n                    <lb n="138"/>\n\n                    and the exit afterwards. They say, however, these favors are not placed\n\n                    <lb n="139"/>\n\n                    in this psalm  in the same order they were done. But, how much earlier, it\n\n                    <lb n="140"/>\n\n                    is placed that much later, and the converse. Since this interpretation is very much\n\n                    <lb n="141"/>\n\n                    intertwined, and it appears to be twisted in some parts, and along with this, significantly prolix, for this reason,\n\n                    <lb n="142"/>\n\n                    I send it away and accept another which agrees with the New Testament.\n\n                    <lb n="143"/>\n\n                    For Paul the apostle in Ephesians 4, quoted the scripture of this\n\n                    <lb n="144"/>\n\n                    psalm about the sending of the Holy Spirit after the ascent of Christ. To each one\n\n                    <lb n="145"/>\n\n                    of us, thanks is given according the the measure of the gift of Jesus Christ because of\n\n                    <lb n="146"/>\n\n                    what he said: "Ascending to heaven, He led captive captivity. He gave\n\n                    <lb n="147"/>\n\n                    gifts to men." This is what the psalm appears to be. He, in this letter, said it should\n\n                    <lb n="148"/>\n\n                    not be an act of thanks for previous favors, but rather a prophecy for\n\n                    <lb n="149"/>\n\n                    future events through Christ; what David sees in spirit, he made into this psalm.\n\n                    <lb n="150"/>\n\n                    Therefore, according to this sense, this psalm is divided into two parts. Because\n\n                    <lb n="151"/>\n\n                    at first it is about the resurrection of Christ. Secondly, it is about His ascension. And\n\n                    <lb n="152"/>\n\n                    along with these things, it is about the following favors after these things. The second part starts here:\n\n                    <lb n="153"/>\n\n                    "Sing to God." Around the beginning, David proposes the resurrection of Christ.\n\n                    <lb n="154"/>\n\n                    a. \u201cMay God arise." Because Christ was dead from\n\n                    <lb n="155"/>\n\n                    the infirmity of His humanity. But he was resurrected from the virtue of his divinity.\n\n                    <lb n="156"/>\n\n                    b. "And His enemies be scattered." That is, the Jews who are in\n\n                    <lb n="157"/>\n\n                    punishment for the death of Christ, since in the time of Titus and Vespasian, they were in part\n\n                    <lb n="158"/>\n\n                    massacred and in part captured and otherwise dispersed through the world, or treated otherwise similarly.\n\n                    <lb n="159"/>\n\n                    "His enemies." That is, evil spirits who, when Christ was rising, were\n\n                    <lb n="160"/>\n\n                    confounded and despoiled. c. "And those who hate Him flee." That is,\n\n                    <lb n="161"/>\n\n                    demons. d. "From His face." Because after the resurrection, in the\n\n                    <lb n="162"/>\n\n                    name of Christ, the demons fled from the possessed.\n\n                    <lb n="163"/>\n\n                    e. "Just as smoke dies out." It is not for this being discovered:\n\n                    <lb n="164"/>\n\n                    how great the corruption of their nature is, since they are\n\n                    <lb n="165"/>\n\n                    immortal. But it is the ejection of them from the power which they\n\n                    <lb n="166"/>\n\n                    had over man. For they were worshipped in public, and in which idols\n\n                    <lb n="167"/>\n\n                    was their idolatry were annihilated throughout the world.\n                </ab>\n            </div>\n        </body>\n    </text>\n</TEI>\n',setXml:r,children:[Object(b.jsx)(A,{}),Object(b.jsx)(q,{}),Object(b.jsx)(ee,{}),Object(b.jsx)(le,{})]})}),Object(b.jsxs)(t.a,{path:"/",children:[Object(b.jsx)(c.PerseidsHeader,{children:"Transcription Editor"}),Object(b.jsx)("main",{role:"main",children:Object(b.jsx)("div",{className:"container text-center",children:Object(b.jsx)(we,{xml:n,setXml:r,urn:s,setUrn:a,image:i,setImage:l,mode:u,setMode:g})})}),Object(b.jsx)(c.PerseidsFooter,{})]})]})})})},de=function(){var e=Object(s.useState)(""),n=Object(u.a)(e,2),r=n[0],a=n[1],i=Object(s.useState)("urn:cite:perseus:miscellanyimgs:image"),l=Object(u.a)(i,2),c=l[0],m=l[1],t=Object(s.useState)(""),g=Object(u.a)(t,2),p=g[0],x=g[1],w=Object(s.useState)("input"),f=Object(u.a)(w,2),o=f[0],y=f[1];return"input"===o?Object(b.jsx)(he,{xml:r,setXml:a,urn:c,setUrn:m,image:p,setImage:x,mode:o,setMode:y}):Object(b.jsx)(ye,{urn:c,setUrn:m,image:p,xml:r,setXml:a})};r(537),r(538),r(539);l.a.render(Object(b.jsx)(a.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(b.jsx)(de,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),window.onbeforeunload=function(){return!0}},7:function(e,n,r){e.exports={container:"Viewer_container__3i4A8",viewer:"Viewer_viewer__1Spx5",draw:"Viewer_draw__2gOsn",box:"Viewer_box__3pcwy",selectBox:"Viewer_selectBox__BhI5r",active:"Viewer_active__3yomw",select:"Viewer_select__il19s",header:"Viewer_header__34LO6",selector:"Viewer_selector__24MV2",disabledSelector:"Viewer_disabledSelector__2KL_J",activeSelector:"Viewer_activeSelector__2VkKS",icon:"Viewer_icon__3g3GG"}},75:function(e,n,r){e.exports={scrollbox:"ScrollBox_scrollbox__FX24s"}},86:function(e,n,r){}},[[540,1,2]]]);
